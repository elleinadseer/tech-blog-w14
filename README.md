## Description

I have been tasked to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well. I have built this site from scratch and deployed it to Heroku. This app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Development
Unfortunately due to time constraints caused by the end of course deadlines I wasn't able to fulfill the full criteria of this task but the main technical aspects of user sign ups, logins, posting and commenting are all there in functionality. I was able to take some of what I already from doing similar work on a project on this bootcamp to apply to this challenge, but despite that it was still difficult to revisit this subject and to apply it to a new website.

## Credits

I have heavily relied on information taught through the modules of the bootcamp to carry out this task; in some instances copying and then editing code from the lessons of this module to fit my needs.
